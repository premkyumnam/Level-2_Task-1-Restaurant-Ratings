    <h1> Level-2_Task-1-Restaurant-Ratings</h1>

🚀 I'm excited to share my Task-1 (Level 2) in the Data Analysis Internship Program with Cognifyz Technologies!

<h1>🔹Project Overview:</h1>

In this project, I analyzed a given restaurant dataset to explore insights on:

1. Analyze the distribution of aggregate ratings and determine the most common rating range.
2. Calculate the average number of votes received by restaurants.


🔹 Key Insights: 

After performing a thorough analysis, here are the findings:

1. The distribution of aggregate ratings are:

    0.0    2148

    1.8       1

    1.9       2

    2.0       7

    2.1      15

    2.2      27

    2.3      47

    2.4      87

    2.5     110

   2.6     191

   2.7     250

   2.8     315

   2.9     381

   3.0     468

   3.1     519

   3.2     522

   3.3     483

   3.4     495

   3.5     480

   3.6     458

   3.7     427

   3.8     399

   3.9     332

   4.0     266

   4.1     274

   4.2     221

   4.3     174

   4.4     143

   4.5      95

   4.6      78

   4.7      41

   4.8      25

   4.9      61

  Name: Aggregate rating, dtype: int64


From the above distribution of aggregate ratings , 
2. The most common rating range is 0.0 with 2148 restaurants. <br>
3. Finally, I got the required average number of votes received by restaurants is 156.77


Thus, I completed the Task-1 of Level-2 in the Data Analysis Internship Program.



🛠️Tools & Technologies Used:

To achieve this Task1 of level 2, I used the following tools and technologies:

1. Python – used as a programming language for data analysis
2. NumPy – used for efficient numerical computations
3. Pandas – used for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis
4. Matplotlib – used for creating visualizations like charts and plots
5. Seaborn – used for advanced statistical data visualization
6. Jupyter Notebook (Primary IDE) - used for writing and executing code.

These tools enabled me to effectively extract insights and meaning from the data.


🎉 I'm grateful for the opportunity to work on this project and sharpen my data analysis skills. Thank you to Cognifyz Technologies for this amazing learning experience! I'm excited to continue growing and taking on new challenges.
